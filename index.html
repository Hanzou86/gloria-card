                    <p>Gloria,<br><br> This has been another amazing year getting to know
                        you. I've seen our relationship grow so much, and me as a person as well
                        being with you. Alot of things have happened this year from you getting your new
                        job to us getting engaged. It shows that things are moving ahead in a lot
                        ways. There are so many new memories this year and im glad I got to share them
                        with you. You're such a wonderful person, I'm so thankful that God brought you into
                        my life. I hope you have a fantastic birthday! 
                        <br><br>
                        Love your fiance: James
